  <h2>Reporting a Security Vulnerability</h2>
  <div class="wrap" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      <p>If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments—such as a
      remote execution exploit—please report it privately by sending an email to 
      <a href="mailto:security@libp2p.io">security@libp2p.io</a>. <b>DO NOT</b>
      file a public issue.</p>

      <p>If the issue is an implementation weakness that cannot be immediately
      exploited or is not yet deployed, please file a public Github issue to get
      it resolved.</p>
